# Covid19-Project


In this project, I utilized Tableau software to create visualizations based on a dataset of corona isolates in Israel.
The interactive dashboards presented crucial insights into the virus's progression, regional variations, and genetic mutations over time.
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of data visualization in understanding complex public health issues.
